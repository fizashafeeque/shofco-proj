# shofco-proj

This project aims to estimate the population of Kibera, the largest urban slum in Nairobi, Kenya. We aim to use satellite images and machine learning methods to count the number of houses, and use the average number of persons per household to complete this task.

## Tools used:
- Label Studio: https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio - an open source tool that allows labelling of unstructured data, along with training and predicting using a model of choice
- MMDetection: A machine learning model used for object detection tasks
- Google Earth images: To obtain satellite images of the slum
